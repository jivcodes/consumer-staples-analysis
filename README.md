### Consumer Staples Sector (Great Recession)

I am linking my Consumer Staples Stock Analysis from Kaggle to Github. Please find the link to the Kaggle project and data analysis results [here](https://www.kaggle.com/arjivj/consumer-staples-sector-great-recession).

In this project, I compare the performance of Consumer Staples stocks to stocks in Finance and Healthcare during The Great Recession to prove that stocks in the consumer staples sector tend to perform better during times of uncertainty.
